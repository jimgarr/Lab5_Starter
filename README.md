1. I don't think you should use a unit test for a messaging feature as that would require the unit test to test how individual components interact with each other. In this case, the unit test would have to verify that the message the user sent is the same that the receiver got, which is two seperate areas of the program.
2. I think you would use a unit test here as you can keep the testing to one section of the program.
